- question: Where?
  answer: In the city centre. We are going to send you all details per email close to the date :)

- question: How much?
  answer: If you want to come on the truck there's a 10‚Ç¨ fee, but you'll get a free t-shirt so, that's nice! If you want to walk in the group behind the track, it's completely free! :) If you want to buy the t-shirt, you can order one for 10‚Ç¨!

- question: Where do I sign up?
  answer: You'll soon be able to sign up using the button below. Places on the Truck are limited, so we'll draw names from a hat. Don't worry, you won't be charged the 10‚Ç¨ if you don't make it in the raffle (but you can still get the t-shirt if you wish!).

  answer: We got your back ;) But bring snacks üçñ

- question: Dress code?
  answer: Be yourself! That's the entire point of this event! But possibly, be youself minimally in your underwear üòé
